Big List of Stuff follows the Character Who Lost Their Voice throughout their daily routine of chores and errands. The tasks are transposed into the surreal form of foam objects, which the Character shuffles through to check off everything on her list. Big List of Stuff was performed in Chicago, IL at No Nation Gallery in November of 2016.
