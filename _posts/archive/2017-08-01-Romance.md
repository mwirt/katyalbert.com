Romance is an episodic drama unfolding amidst several backdrop and costume changes. Comprised of text, actions, and short scenes, it shows isolated figures caught up in their own lives and minds; funneling intense rage, comedy, and conviction with the fever pitch of the contemporary mindset. 

Romance was performed on tour in August of 2017 at Pinky Swear (Chicago, IL), PJâ€™s Lagerhouse (Detroit, MI), Living Room (Toronto, ON), Drones (Montreal, QC), Vital Joint (New York City, NY), Fort Cheese (Providence, RI), EMP (Baltimore, MD), Hive Mind (Akron, OH).
