Mothergirlâ€™s performances in E.S.P. TV #76 & #77 are short serial episodes. Characters Gina and Candice express relationship tensions resulting from a bad haircut, spilled nail polish, and embarrassing television appearances.

Mothergirl performed with ONO, Nick Ciontea, Fern Silva, and Matchess. The video was filmed live at the Nightingale Cinema in Chicago, IL.

Live video mix and manipulation by Scott Kiernan and Victoria Keddie
