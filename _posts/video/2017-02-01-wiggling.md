*One Half Hour of Wiggling* is a reality entertainment program. Three characters wiggle their bodies at various locations. An omniscient voice narrates the ensuing conflict between the three wigglers. Like a half hour long reality television show streaming from the internet, the action cuts away from time to time to go to commercial break, but there are no commercials. Teasers and recaps orient the audience in these moments of transition.


One Half Hour of Wiggling was created for ACRE TV and streamed live for Direct Object/Direct Action February â€“ March 2015. The video is a collaboration between Mothergirl and artist Blair Bogin.
