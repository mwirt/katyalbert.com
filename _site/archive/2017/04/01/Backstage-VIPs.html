<p>Backstage VIPs creates the ultimate performance art experience. Audience members are given exclusive access to the artist in their backstage dressing room, provided with food and drink, given insight to the onstage action pre, mid, and post performance. Onstage the artist presents their well-loved persona, The Character Who Lost Their Voice.</p>

<p>The Backstage VIPs was performed on tour in April 2017 at The Compound (Chicago, IL), Magic Lanes (Seattle, WA), Neurolux (Boise, ID), Daleyâ€™s Clothing (Salt Lake City, UT), Backspace (Denver, CO), Front/Space (Kansas City, MO), and The Split (Des Moines, IA).</p>
