<p><em>Progress in the World of Fantasy</em> is an experimental performance and music piece addressing notions of projected desire and the female performing body. Viewers are initiated into an environment wedged between pleasure and revulsion â€” a landscape of desire, object worship, bodily mess, and song. The work was created and performed in collaboration with musician and artist Whitney Allen.</p>

<p>Progress in the World of Fantasy was a performance tour through the Eastern United States in 2015. Documentation by Blair Bogin at Tritriangle, Chicago, IL.</p>
