<p>In <em>Wet Sponge</em>, Mothergirl channel the semi-organic forms and abstracted sentimentality of Morgan Richardson’s ceramic work. Mothergirl perform in and on their sculpted landscape of two large, wet sponges embedded with waterproof contact microphones. Nudity and sound manipulation (distortion from the microphones) are used to amplify moments of tenderness, rage, care, and vulnerability between the two women. The environment is friendly yet uncanny; the play is boundless and joyful.</p>

<p><em>Wet Sponge</em> was originally created and performed in conjunction with Morgan Richardson’s MFA ceramics exhibition “Buttermilk Biscuits” in 2015. Documentation by Blair Bogin.</p>
